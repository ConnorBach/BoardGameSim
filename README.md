Multiplayer AI Simulation

Created by Connor Bach, Ben Bernhard, Jack Collins, Alex Roerty, and Luke Weller

The simulation revolves around 5 AI players vying for control of a fictional government. Two teams compete to play cards and
either elect or defeat a tyrant character. Each player is capable of utilizing different strategies which change the outcome of
the game. Simulations can be animated for single games, displaying real time card playing and suspicion values. Additionally,
large numbers of games can be run, generating data for team win percentages, win conditions and strategy effectiveness.
